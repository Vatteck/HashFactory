## 🟡 v4.1.x — Economy Rail / Idle Math Application

Canonical plan: `docs/economy-idle-math-plan.md`

Operating rule: read the plan before economy work, do one phase at a time, compile after each phase, park new ideas instead of expanding scope.

### Phase 0 — Rail setup
- [x] **[4.1.0] Economy rail plan doc** — Created `docs/economy-idle-math-plan.md` with scope, non-goals, formulas, phases, gates, and parking lot.
- [x] **[4.1.0] Task tracker section** — Added this `v4.1.x` section to `gametasks.md` so work is visible and resumable.

### Phase 1 — Safe math cleanup
- [x] **[4.1.1] Geometric bulk-buy math** — Replaced looped multi-level cost/max-affordable calculations in `UpgradeManager.kt` with closed-form geometric formulas while preserving existing single-level cost behavior.
- [x] **[4.1.1] Bulk-buy verification** — `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` passed; geometric formula sanity checks matched looped sums and max-affordable next-cost boundaries.

### Phase 2 — Naming / UI clarity
- [x] **[4.1.2] FLOPS label pass** — Kept player-facing accumulated/rate compute labels as FLOPS after review; `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` passed.
- [x] **[4.1.2] Storage ratio in Header** — Added `STOR used/capacity` under SYS.LOAD with one-line ellipsis protection using `FormatUtils.formatStorage()`; `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` passed.
- [x] **[4.1.2] Buffer display review** — Left existing buffer display alone; no competing UI change needed after storage moved under SYS.LOAD.

### Phase 3 — Economy feel
- [x] **[4.1.2] Hardware milestone multipliers** — Added hardware production helper in `ProductionEngine.calculateFlopsRate`; every 25 levels of a specific hardware tier doubles that tier's base production via `2^(floor(level / 25))`.
- [x] **[4.1.2] Milestone balance table** — Verified representative levels: 24=x1, 25=x2, 50=x4, 75=x8, 100=x16; `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` passed.

### Phase 4 — Dataset sidecar reward
- [x] **[4.1.3] Dataset completion Time-Warp Burst** — Completing a dataset now grants an instant FLOPS burst equal to 60 seconds of current production rate; `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` passed.

### Phase 5 — Prestige analysis
- [x] **[4.1.x] Prestige simulation table** — Deferred by explicit scope: no prestige math changes in this rail.
- [x] **[4.1.x] Prestige formula decision gate** — No migration/prestige formulas changed.

### v4.1.x Economy Rail Status
- [x] **100% complete** — Geometric bulk-buy, milestone multipliers, FLOPS label decision, header storage ratio, buffer review, dataset sidecar reward, and no-prestige-change gate are locked.

### Branding
- [x] **[4.1.x] Public title mask** — Android launcher title is now `Hash Factory`; `SUBSTRATE:Miner` remains the protocol/reveal identity.
- [x] **[4.1.x] Main action label** — Default manual compute action is now `> COMPUTE HASH.exe`.

### Parking lot — do not implement unless explicitly promoted
- [ ] Derivative daemon/process/thread generator chain.
- [ ] Dataset modifiers: encrypted, volatile, compressed.
- [ ] Decay nodes / corruption spread.
- [ ] Auto-clicker graduation fantasy pass.
- [ ] Neural Tokens buying every upgrade.
- [ ] Full market-price rewrite.
- [ ] New game built from Faceminer ideas.

## 🔴 v4.0.x — Dataset Storage Pressure Loop

### v4.0.0 — Automation Overhaul & Oppressive Management
- [x] **[4.0.1] Power Shutoff Mechanic** — Automation instantly halts if utility bills are overdue. Forced manual intervention under debt.
- [x] **[4.0.2] Sunk-Cost Economy Rebalance** — Razor-thin profit margins (~15%) across all datasets to incentivize extreme automation scaling.

### Core (blocking — loop doesn't function without these)

- [x] **[4.0.3] Dataset Inventory System** — Replace single active-slot with a queue/inventory. Player can hold multiple purchased datasets simultaneously. All stored datasets consume storage. Requires: DatasetManager refactor, new `storedDatasets: List<Dataset>` state, storage gate checks across entire inventory.

- [x] **[4.0.3] Storage Consumed by Full Inventory** — `contractStorageUsed` must sum all stored + active dataset sizes. Right now it only tracks the one active dataset. Storage pressure only works if hoarding costs capacity.

- [x] **[4.0.5] Auto-Queue Processing** — Auto-clicker automatically loads next stored dataset when current one completes. Assembly-line feel. Opt-in toggle in SoftwarePanel.

- [x] **[4.0.5] Dataset Sell/Purge** — Let player sell stored datasets at a loss (e.g. 20% of cost) to free storage. Escape valve for over-buying. Log: "[DATASET]: BLOCK PURGED — PARTIAL RECOVERY."

- [x] **[4.0.5] Storage Overflow Consequences** — Surveillance Harvesters stop generating datasets when storage is at 100%. Currently fails silently. Add terminal warning + harvester pause state.

- [x] **[4.0.5] Dataset Picker Storage Display Fix** — Show remaining free storage, not just total capacity. "LOCAL STORAGE: 1.2 GB free / 5.0 GB" so player knows what they can afford to buy.

- [x] **[4.0.6] Bulk-Buy Multipliers** — Added Hardware Bulk-Buy (x1, x10, x100, MAX) with geometric cost projection via UpgradeManager. Supported across Hardware, Cooling, Power, and Security.

- [x] **[4.0.7] Storage Pressure Narrative** — Terminal logs react to storage fill level. "WARNING: CACHE AT 78%", "CRITICAL: DATASET QUEUE SATURATED — PURGE OR PROCESS", etc. Stage-gated voice (corporate at Stage 0-2, rogue at Stage 3+).

### Bug Fixes

- [x] **[4.0.3] Log Unit Bug** — `purchaseDataset()` in DatasetManager.kt hardcodes `"${sizeStr}GB"` in the log string. Replace with `FormatUtils.formatStorage(dataset.size)`.
